# V6 Engine CAD Modelling and Process Development

## **Overview**
This project focuses on the **CAD modelling, process selection, and manufacturing analysis** of a **V6 Engine assembly**, incorporating over **25 parts** and **5 major subassemblies**. The aim is to develop virtual product designs, optimize the manufacturing process, and evaluate 3D printing file formats for production.

---

## **Objectives**
1. **CAD Modelling**:
   - Develop 3D models for various components of the V6 engine, including crankshafts, pistons, connecting rods, and more.
   - Use advanced SolidWorks features for detailed designs.
2. **Process Selection**:
   - Evaluate manufacturing processes for critical components like the connecting rod.
   - Compare **forging**, **machining**, and **casting** processes for high production efficiency.
3. **3D Printing Format Analysis**:
   - Analyze file formats (STL, IGES, STEP) for their compatibility with 3D printing and manufacturing.

## **Features and Components**

### **1. Engine Crankshaft**
- **Design Features**:
  - Utilized **move/copy**, **chamfer**, and **fillet** tools for designing complex features.
  - Rotated camshaft pairs by ±120° for symmetry.

## **Process Selection**
1. **Forging for Connecting Rods**:
   - **Primary Process**:
     - High fatigue strength and reduced machining make forging the best choice.
   - **Alternative Processes**:
     - Sand casting for intricate designs, though less efficient for large production batches.
2. **Machining Processes**:
   - Sequence includes engraving, milling, drilling, and laser cutting for precision manufacturing.

## **3D Printing File Formats**
1. **STL Format**:
   - Widely used for 3D printing.
   - Lacks support for color and texture data.
2. **IGES Format**:
   - Retains curvature details but prone to data loss in complex models.
3. **STEP Format**:
   - Supports colors, tolerance, and material properties, making it ideal for data-rich applications.

## **How to Use**
1. **CAD Modelling**:
   - Open provided CAD files in SolidWorks or any compatible CAD software.
   - Modify or analyze components as needed.
2. **3D Printing**:
   - Use STL files for 3D printing with software like Ultimaker Cura.
   - Analyze IGES and STEP formats for additional design details.
3. **Process Analysis**:
   - Follow the provided manufacturing processes for production planning.
